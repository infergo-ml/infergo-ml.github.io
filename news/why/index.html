<h2 id="challenges-of-server-side-probabilistic-programming">Challenges of Server-Side Probabilistic Programming</h2>

<p>Incorporating a probabilistic program, or rather a probabilistic
procedure, within a larger code body appears to be rather
straightforward: one implements the model in the probabilistic
programming language, fetches and preprocesses the data in the
host programming language, passes the data and the model to an
inference algorithm, and post-processes the results in the
host programming language again to make algorithmic
decisions based on inference outcomes. However, complex
server-side software systems make integration of probabilistic
inference challenging.</p>

<h3 id="simulation-vs-inference">Simulation vs. inference</h3>

<p>Probabilistic models often follow a design pattern of
simulation-inference: a significant part of the model is a
simulator, running an algorithm with fixed parameters; the
optimal parameters, or their distribution, are to be inferred.
The inferred parameters are then used by the software system to
execute the simulation independently of inference for
forecasting and decision making.</p>

<p>This pattern suggests re-use of the simulator: instead of
implementing the simulator twice, in the probabilistic model and
in the host environment, the same code can serve both purposes.
However to achieve this, the host language must coincide with
the implementation language of the probabilistic model, on one
hand, and allow a computationally efficient implementation of
the simulation, on the other hand. Some probabilistic systems
(<a href="https://www.cra.com/work/case-studies/figaro">Figaro</a>, <a href="http://anglican.ml/">Anglican</a>, <a href="http://turing.ml/">Turing</a>)
are built with tight integration with the host environment in
mind; more often than not though the probabilistic code is
not trivial to re-use.</p>

<h3 id="data-interface">Data interface</h3>

<p>In a server-side application data for inference comes from a
variety of sources: network, databases, distributed file
systems, and in many different formats. Efficient inference
depends on fast data access and updating. Libraries for data
access and manipulation are available in the host environment.
While the host environment can be used as a proxy retrieving and
transforming the data, such as in the case of <a href="http://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a>
integrations, sometimes direct access from the probabilistic
code is the preferred option, for example when the data is
streamed or retrieved conditionally.</p>

<h3 id="integration-and-deployment">Integration and deployment</h3>

<p>Deployment of server-side software systems is a delicate process
involving automatic builds and maintenance of dependencies.
Adding  a component, which possibly introduces additional
software dependencies or even a separate runtime, complicates
deployment. Minimizing the burden of probabilistic programming
on the integration and deployment process should be a major
consideration in design or selection of probabilistic
programming tools.  Probabilistic programming systems that are
implemented or provide an interface in a popular programming
language, e.g.  Python (<a href="http://edwardlib.org/">Edward</a>,
<a href="http://pyro.ai/">Pyro</a>) are easier to integrate and deploy, however
the smaller the footprint of a probabilistic system, the easier
is the adoption.</p>

<h2 id="probabilistic-programming-facility-for-go">Probabilistic Programming Facility for Go</h2>

<p>Based on the experience of developing and deploying solutions
using different probabilistic environments, I propose
guidelines to implementation of a probabilistic programming
facility for server-side applications. I believe that these
guidelines, when followed, help easier integration of
probabilistic programming inference into large-scale server-side
software systems.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A probabilistic model should be programmed in the host
programming language. The facility may impose a discipline on
model implementation, such as through interface constraints, but
otherwise supporting unrestricted use of the host language for
implementation of the model.</p></li>

<li><p>Built-in and user-defined data structures and libraries
should be accessible in the probabilistic programming model.
Inference techniques relying on the code structure, such as
those based on automatic differentiation, should support the
use of common data structures of the host language.</p></li>

<li><p>The model code should be reusable between inference and
simulation. The code which is not required solely for inference
should be written once for both inference of parameters and use
of the parameters in the host environment.  It should be
possible to run simulation outside the probabilistic model without
runtime or memory overhead imposed by inference needs.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In line with the guidelines, I have implemented a probabilistic
programming facility for the Go programming language, <code>infergo</code>
(<a href="http://infergo.org/">http://infergo.org/</a>). I have chosen Go
because Go is a small but expressive programming language with
efficient implementation, which has recently become quite
popular for computation-intensive server-side programming.  This
facility is already used in production environment for inference
of mission-critical algorithm parameters.</p>

<p>A probabilistic model in <code>infergo</code> is an implementation
of the <code>Model</code> interface requiring a single method
<code>Observe</code> which accepts a vector (a Go <em>slice</em>) of
floats, the parameters to infer, and returns a single float,
interpreted as unnormalized log-likelihood of the posterior
distribution. Implementation of model methods can be written
in virtually unrestricted Go and use any Go libraries.</p>

<p>For inference, <code>infergo</code> relies on automatic
differentiation. The source code of the model is
translated by a command-line tool provided by <code>infergo</code>
into an equivalent model with reverse-mode automatic
differentiation of the log-likelihood with respect
to the parameters applied. The differentiation operates
on the built-in floating-point type and incurs only a small
computational overhead. However, even this overhead is avoided
when the model code is executed outside of inference algorithms:
both the original and the differentiated model are
simultaneously available to the rest of the program code, so
the methods can be called on the differentiated model for
inference, and on the original model for the most efficient
execution with the inferred parameters.</p>

<p>The Go programming language and development environment offer
capabilities which made implementation of <code>infergo</code>
affordable.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Go parser and abstract syntax tree serializer are
a part of the standard library. Parsing, transforming,
and generating Go source code is straightforward and
effortless.</li>
<li>Type inference (or <em>type checking</em> as it is
called in the Go ecosystem), also provided in the
standard library, augments parsing and allows to
selectively apply transformation-based automatic
differentiation  based on static expression types.</li>
<li>Go compiles and runs fast. Fast compilation and
execution speeds allow to use the same facility for both
exploratory design of probabilistic models and for
inference in production environment.</li>
<li>Go offers efficient parallel execution as a
first-class feature, via so-called <em>goroutines</em>.
Goroutines streamline implementation of sampling-based
inference algorithms. Sample generators and consumers
are run in parallel, communicating through channels.
Inference is easy to parallelize in order to exploit
hardware multi-processing, and samples are retrieved
lazily for postprocessing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Table 1 provides memory consumption and running time
measurements on basic models to illustrate  <code>infergo</code>&rsquo;s
performance.  The measurements were obtained on a 2.3GHz Intel
Core 5 CPU with 8GB of memory for 1000 iterations of Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo with 10 leapfrog steps. Note that log-likelihood
computation for standard distributions is not optimized yet.
Quite the opposite: since models in <code>infergo</code> are fully
composable, primitive distributions are themselves implemented
as <code>infergo</code> models and automatically differentiated.</p>

</table>

<p>A lightweight probabilistic programming facility similar to
<code>infergo</code> can be added to most modern general-purpose
programming languages, in particular those used in implementing
large-scale software systems, making probabilistic
programming inference more accessible in server-side
applications.</p>
